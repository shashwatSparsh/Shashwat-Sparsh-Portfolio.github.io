Aerospace Masters Candidate with a passion for aerodynamics and Unmanned Aerial System Design (UAS). I have a wide breadth of academic and research experience in experimental fluid mechanics, UAS design, development, and testing, and technical writing. Prior to beginning my masters degree at Cal Poly SLO, I worked as an Associate Project Engineer at Illumina for facility infrastructure upgrade and maintenance projects. I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Aerodynamics and Aircraft Performance in June 2022.

Recently I have been picking up new skills in python scripting using _openCv_ and statistical regression methods using _MiniTab_.
